# Landing_Page_Project
In this project,I fully combined my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to create a fully functional multi-section landing page.
Furthermore, by manipulating the DOM, more sections were added to the dynamically grow the webpage.

## Architecture
This project has the structure depicted below.

css -> styles.css  

index.html

js -> app.js

README.md

## Developmental Strategy
1. Read Through the Starter Code
2. Linked The js file with the html file
3. Built the HTML Sections
4. Built the Navigation Bar
5.Added functionality for the section in view
6.Added smooth scroll functionality to sections.
7.Added an active state to the navigation items.



## Functionality
It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
When an item from the navigation menu is clicked, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.
When a section is in the viewport, it is clearly highlithed in the navigation bar.

## Usability
All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
A layout of the landing page and navigation bar is created is to be responsive across all these devices.
